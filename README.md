# Samping-and-holding

This repo demonstrates how to sample an analog signal  before it gets quantified. By using the arduino IDE to create a script that outputs a sine, ramp or triangular waveforms that will be sampled via an S/H circuit.

Hardware needed:

* 8-bit R2R Digital to analog converter.
* Arduino uno or nano board.
* Sampling and holding circuit.
* An oscilloscope to see the sampled waveforms.

Software needed:

* Arduino IDE.

The schematics are attached in this repository.
