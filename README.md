# Samping-and-holding
This repo demonstrates how to sample an analog signal  before it gets quantified. I'll be using the arduino IDE to create the script that outputs a sine, ramp or triangular waveforms that will be sampled via a S/H circuit.

Hardware needed:

* 8-bit R2R Digital to analog converter.
* Arduino uno or nano board.
* Sampling and holding circuit.
* An oscilloscope to see the sampled waveforms if you want to, but they can also be printed on the serial monitor.

Software needed:

* Arduino IDE.

The schematics are attached on this repository.
